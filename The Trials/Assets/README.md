# Getting Started

1. At the top of the screen go to Window > General > Test Runner.
2. You can dock the test runner wherever you want.
3. Inside the test runner click Edit Mode, and Run All. The tests should all be failing right now.
4. Now you just fix the code and click Run All again to check if the tests pass.
5. Get started with the "Functions_0" file inside the "Scripts/Trial 1" folder.

You can click on the failing tests to see the logs such as:
---
Expected: 15
But was: 10
---

Don't forget to use `Debug.Log();`
